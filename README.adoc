= Clojure CIDER DAP server

Will enable rich, interactive, debugging UIs in Neovim, VS Code and any other editor that supports DAP. See https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui[nvim-dap-ui] for an example.

Coming "soon"! Until then, you can use the very basic https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] debugger support. It's not a great UI, but you can learn about it on https://github.com/Olical/conjure/wiki/Clojure-nREPL-CIDER-debugger[the Conjure wiki].
